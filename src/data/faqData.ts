    question: "Why choose sustainable wooden products over plastic toys?",
    answer: "Sustainable wooden toys from native New Zealand timber offer significant advantages over plastic alternatives. Our handcrafted toys are built to last generations, reducing waste and environmental impact. Native timbers like Kauri, Rimu, and Macrocarpa are naturally durable, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Unlike plastic toys that break easily and end up in landfills, our wooden creations become family heirlooms. They're also free from harmful chemicals like BPA, phthalates, and PVC found in many plastic toys. For eco-conscious families and Montessori schools across New Zealand, choosing wooden toys means investing in quality, safety, and sustainability."

    question: "What makes handmade wooden toys better for child development?",
    answer: "Handmade wooden toys support natural child development in ways plastic toys cannot. The weight, texture, and warmth of real wood provide sensory-rich experiences that engage children's tactile development. Wooden toys are open-ended, encouraging imagination and creative play rather than limiting children to pre-programmed functions. Montessori educators across New Zealand choose our wooden toys because they allow children to explore cause and effect, develop fine motor skills, and engage in meaningful play. The simplicity of wooden toys - free from lights, sounds, and batteries - helps children develop concentration and independent play skills essential for early learning."

    question: "How do I choose quality wooden crafts for my family?",
    answer: "Quality wooden crafts should meet several key criteria. Look for items made from solid hardwood (not plywood or particleboard) with smooth, well-sanded surfaces free from splinters. Check that finishes are non-toxic and food-safe - we use natural oils only. Quality craftsmanship shows in tight joints, even cuts, and attention to detail. For children's toys, ensure pieces are appropriately sized to prevent choking hazards and built sturdy enough for active play. Native New Zealand timbers like Rimu and Kauri indicate premium quality and local craftsmanship. Finally, choose pieces from established craftspeople with reviews and a proven track record - our 4.9-star rating reflects over 15 years of satisfied families and Montessori schools throughout New Zealand."

    question: "What age range are your wooden toys suitable for?",
    answer: "Our wooden toys cater to children from 6 months through primary school age. Simple push toys and teethers suit babies 6-18 months, while our wooden cars, trucks, and trains engage toddlers aged 18 months to 5 years. More complex building sets and intricate vehicles appeal to children 3-8 years old. Each product listing specifies recommended ages, but wooden toys' open-ended nature means children often enjoy them well beyond typical age ranges. Montessori schools use our toys across multiple age groups because quality wooden toys grow with the child rather than becoming obsolete."

    question: "Are your wooden toys safe for babies and toddlers?",
    answer: "Yes, all our wooden toys are designed with child safety as the top priority. We use only food-safe, non-toxic finishes - natural oils with no harmful chemicals, paint, or varnish. Every piece is hand-sanded smooth to eliminate splinters and sharp edges. Our toys are made from solid hardwood with no small detachable parts that could pose choking hazards for younger children. We follow Montessori safety principles and New Zealand safety standards. Over 30 Montessori schools trust our toys for their youngest learners, and many families use them as safe teething toys for babies."

    question: "How do wooden toys compare to plastic for Montessori learning?",
    answer: "Wooden toys align perfectly with Montessori principles while plastic toys often contradict them. Montessori education emphasizes natural materials, sensory experiences, and reality-based learning - wooden toys provide authentic weight, texture, and temperature that engage multiple senses. Plastic toys with electronic features do the playing for children, while wooden toys require active imagination and problem-solving. The simplicity of wooden toys helps children develop concentration without overstimulation. Montessori classrooms across New Zealand choose our wooden toys because they support independent play, fine motor development, and open-ended exploration - core Montessori objectives that plastic toys rarely achieve."

    question: "What types of wooden toys do you offer?",
    answer: "We craft a comprehensive range of wooden toys including push and pull toys for babies, wooden cars and trucks in various sizes, train sets and individual carriages, building blocks and construction sets, pretend play items like wooden food and kitchen sets, and sensory toys for early learners. Popular items include our handcrafted wooden utes (utility vehicles), logging trucks, race cars, and farm vehicles - all inspired by real New Zealand vehicles children see in their daily lives. Each toy is made from native timber including Rimu, Kauri, and Macrocarpa, showcasing the natural grain and character of New Zealand wood."

    question: "Why choose wooden cutting boards over plastic or glass?",
    answer: "Wooden cutting boards from native New Zealand timber offer superior performance and food safety compared to plastic or glass. Unlike plastic boards that develop deep knife grooves harboring bacteria, quality hardwood has natural antimicrobial properties and self-heals from minor cuts. Glass boards are harsh on knife edges, causing rapid dulling, while wooden boards protect blade sharpness. Our Rimu and Macrocarpa cutting boards are gentle on knives, naturally resistant to bacteria when properly maintained, and add warmth and beauty to your kitchen. They're also environmentally sustainable - a quality wooden board lasts decades while plastic boards need frequent replacement, creating unnecessary waste."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for wooden kitchen utensils and cutting boards?",
    answer: "Proper care keeps wooden kitchenware beautiful and functional for generations. Hand wash items with warm soapy water immediately after use - never use a dishwasher as high heat and harsh detergents damage wood. Dry thoroughly with a towel rather than air-drying to prevent warping or cracking. Apply food-safe mineral oil or board cream monthly to maintain moisture and prevent the wood from drying out. For cutting boards, occasionally sanitize by rubbing with coarse salt and lemon, then rinse and oil. Store in a dry location with good air circulation. With this simple routine, our native timber kitchenware develops a rich patina and serves your family for decades."

    question: "What makes native New Zealand timber special for kitchenware?",
    answer: "Native New Zealand timbers like Rimu, Kauri, and Macrocarpa possess unique characteristics ideal for kitchenware. These hardwoods are naturally dense and durable, resisting warping and cracking better than softwoods or imported species. The tight grain structure provides natural antimicrobial properties and creates beautiful, distinctive patterns that make each piece unique. New Zealand timbers have been sustainably harvested and used for generations, proving their longevity. Unlike bamboo or imported woods with unknown origins, our native timber comes from verified sustainable sources. The warmth and character of Rimu's reddish tones or Macrocarpa's honey hues add authentic New Zealand craftsmanship to your kitchen while supporting local forestry practices."
