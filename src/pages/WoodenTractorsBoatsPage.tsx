        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our wooden tractors and boats are handcrafted in Whangarei from native New Zealand timbers — primarily Macrocarpa and Rimu. Each piece is shaped and finished entirely by hand in our Tikipunga workshop, creating toys with the solid weight and natural character that only genuine handcrafted woodwork delivers.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Farm life and the sea are woven into New Zealand's identity — and our wooden tractors and boats bring that character into children's play. Solid, satisfying, and beautifully made, these toys spark imaginations and withstand the enthusiastic play of real children.

      <section className="mb-10 bg-amber-50 rounded-xl p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Macrocarpa & Rimu — Strength with Character</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa) is a robust, golden-toned timber with a pleasant natural aroma and attractive grain. Its density and stability make it ideal for toys that need to handle robust play — it resists denting and wear while remaining workable enough for the detailed shaping that tractors and boats require.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Rimu adds warmth and richness to the mix — its reddish-brown tones and fine grain create beautiful contrast and visual depth. Together, these timbers produce toys with genuine character and the satisfying solidity that makes wooden toys so enduring.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          All timber is sourced from legal, sustainable supplies — primarily salvaged or recycled native timber — to protect New Zealand's native forests.

      {/* NZ Connection */}
      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">A Connection to New Zealand</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          New Zealand is a farming and maritime nation — tractors and boats are part of the landscape that Kiwi children grow up in. Our wooden tractors and boats connect children to that world in a tactile, imaginative way that electronic toys simply cannot replicate.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Farm play builds an understanding of where food comes from and how it's grown. Maritime play sparks curiosity about the sea, navigation, and the natural world. These are rich, culturally meaningful themes for New Zealand children — and our handcrafted toys bring them to life in the most natural way possible.
        </p>

      {/* Development */}
      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Developmental Benefits</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The natural weight of wooden tractors and boats provides important sensory and proprioceptive feedback that supports motor development. Farm and maritime-themed play encourages rich imaginative storytelling, cooperative play, and an understanding of the wider world.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Unlike toys with pre-programmed responses, our tractors and boats encourage children to create their own narratives — a farm becomes a working landscape, a boat becomes an ocean adventure. This open-ended play is at the heart of Montessori learning philosophy and is why our toys are trusted by Montessori educators across New Zealand.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Care & Maintenance</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Dust regularly with a soft dry cloth. Avoid prolonged exposure to water or direct sunlight. Every 6–12 months, apply a small amount of natural wood oil to maintain the finish. Our toys are built tough, but a little care will keep them beautiful for generations.
