        question: 'Is Kauri wood safe for teething babies?',
        answer: 'Yes, absolutely. We finish our Kauri toys with food-safe natural oils that are completely safe for babies to mouth. Kauri\'s fine grain and smooth finish mean no splinter risk, and the wood\'s natural resins are non-toxic.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is Kauri more expensive than other wooden toys?',
        answer: 'Kauri is a premium native New Zealand timber that\'s no longer commercially harvested. We source reclaimed and swamp Kauri through regulated channels. The wood\'s exceptional properties—strength, durability, fine grain—combined with its rarity make it more costly, but a Kauri toy will outlast cheaper alternatives by decades.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long will a Kauri toy last?',
        answer: 'With basic care, a well-crafted Kauri toy will last for generations. We\'ve seen Kauri toys from the early 1900s still in beautiful condition. The wood\'s natural durability and resistance to decay mean your Kauri toy can become a genuine family heirloom.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is using Kauri wood environmentally responsible?',
        answer: 'Yes. We only use reclaimed Kauri from old buildings or swamp Kauri excavated under permit—never from living trees. Living Kauri are protected. By transforming salvaged timber into heirloom toys used for generations, we\'re honoring this timber rather than letting it go to waste.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the difference between regular Kauri and swamp Kauri?',
        answer: 'Swamp Kauri has been preserved in peat swamps for thousands of years. It\'s even denser and more stable than regular Kauri, with sometimes darker, richer coloring. Both are excellent for toys, but swamp Kauri is particularly prized for its history and unique character.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can damaged Kauri toys be repaired?',
        answer: 'Yes, one of Kauri\'s great advantages is repairability. Minor scratches can be sanded out and the toy refinished with food-safe oil. Unlike plastic toys that break permanently, Kauri toys can be restored to like-new condition even after decades of use.'
