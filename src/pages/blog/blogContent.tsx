    <p className="mb-6">
      As a parent, you want the best for your child—toys that are safe, engaging, and worth the investment. Walk into any toy store, and you'll face a wall of brightly colored plastic options. But more parents are discovering what generations before knew: natural wooden toys offer something fundamentally different.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations, we craft toys from New Zealand native timbers like Kauri, Rimu, and Macrocarpa in our Whangarei workshop. After years of watching children play with our handmade creations, we've seen firsthand why natural wood consistently outperforms plastic. Here's what you need to know.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Safety Difference: What's Really in Your Child's Hands?
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys often contain chemicals that parents can't see or smell. Phthalates, BPA, and PVC are common in cheaper plastics, and even "BPA-free" alternatives may contain equally concerning substitutes. When babies mouth plastic toys—which they inevitably do—they're exposed to whatever chemicals leach from the material.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Natural wooden toys eliminate this worry entirely. Quality wooden toys use food-safe finishes or natural oils, with no synthetic chemicals to leach out. Our toys at Poppa's are finished with natural oils that are completely safe for teething babies. The wood itself—especially native New Zealand timbers—contains no harmful additives, just the natural grain your child can see and feel.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The difference matters most during those crucial early months when everything goes straight into your baby's mouth.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Durability: The Real Cost Over Time
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's a truth most parents discover the hard way: cheap plastic toys are expensive.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys crack, break, and fade. That brightly colored truck that seemed sturdy in the store? Six months later, it's missing wheels, the paint is chipping, and it's headed for landfill. The average plastic toy lasts 1-2 years before it's replaced.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden toys are built for generations. A well-crafted wooden toy car will outlast dozens of plastic equivalents. Our Kauri toy vehicles have been passed down from older siblings to younger ones, still smooth and beautiful after years of play. The natural timber actually improves with age, developing a warm patina that tells the story of childhood adventures.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When you calculate cost-per-year of use, wooden toys are often the more economical choice—not to mention the only toys your children might one day give to their own kids.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Sensory Development: Why Texture Matters
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys feel the same whether they're a car, a block, or a tea set—smooth, uniform, synthetic. Children learn about their world through touch, but plastic offers limited sensory information.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Natural wooden toys provide rich tactile experiences. Run your hand over a piece of Rimu, and you'll feel the unique grain pattern. Macrocarpa has a different weight and warmth than Kauri. These natural variations help develop fine motor skills and sensory processing abilities crucial in early childhood.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Each wooden toy communicates information: this timber is heavier, this grain runs this direction, this surface has this texture. Your child's brain is processing all of it, building neural connections that plastic's uniformity simply can't provide.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Imagination vs. Distraction
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys often come with built-in functions—lights, sounds, predetermined actions. Press this button, get that response. These features seem engaging, but they do the imagining for your child.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden toys are wonderfully simple. A wooden tractor doesn't make engine noises—your child does. A wooden block doesn't light up—your child decides if it's a phone, a car, or part of a castle. This simplicity isn't a limitation; it's an invitation to creative play.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      As any Montessori educator will tell you, open-ended toys develop problem-solving skills and creativity in ways that feature-heavy plastic toys cannot. Our Wooden Pine Trolley and Blocks exemplify this principle—simple, beautiful, and endlessly versatile.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Environmental Impact: Thinking Beyond Today
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys tell a troubling story. Made from petroleum, manufactured overseas, shipped long distances, then discarded after brief use. Most end up in landfill where they'll sit for 400+ years. Even "recyclable" plastics rarely get recycled—the complex plastics in toys don't fit standard recycling streams.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Natural wooden toys offer a different path. Sustainably harvested timber, crafted locally in Whangarei, and completely biodegradable at end of life. Though honestly, end of life rarely comes—quality wooden toys get used, loved, and passed on rather than thrown away.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When you choose wooden toys, you're not just making a decision for your child—you're making one for their world.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Weight of Quality
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's something parents notice immediately: wooden toys have satisfying weight.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys feel insubstantial, even when they're large. They're easily knocked over, feel fragile in small hands, and somehow seem disposable even when new.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden toys have presence. That solid weight provides important feedback for developing motor skills. When your toddler stacks wooden blocks, they're learning about balance, gravity, and spatial relationships in ways that lightweight plastic blocks can't teach. Our handcrafted vehicles have the heft of real objects, helping children understand cause and effect as they push and play.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Making the Practical Choice
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      "But aren't wooden toys more expensive?" It's a fair question with a surprising answer.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Yes, quality wooden toys have a higher upfront cost than cheap plastic alternatives. But consider:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> One wooden toy outlasts 5-10 plastic replacements</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-child use:</strong> Wooden toys survive siblings where plastic doesn't</li>
      <li><strong>Resale value:</strong> Quality wooden toys retain value; used plastic toys have none</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional value:</strong> Children form attachments to meaningful objects, not disposable ones</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The real question isn't "can I afford wooden toys?" It's "can I afford to keep replacing plastic ones?"
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What to Look for in Quality Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Not all wooden toys are created equal. Here's what distinguishes quality craftsmanship:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Solid wood construction:</strong> Avoid plywood or particle board disguised as "wood"</li>
      <li><strong>Smooth finish:</strong> No splinters, rough edges, or unfinished surfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Natural oils or waxes:</strong> Skip toys with thick paint that chips or flakes</li>
      <li><strong>Simple design:</strong> The best toys don't need batteries or complicated features</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriate size:</strong> Large enough to be safe for the age group, small enough to manipulate easily</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's, we use native New Zealand timbers and finish each piece by hand. You can feel the difference in quality the moment you pick up one of our toys.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Bottom Line for Parents
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The choice between wooden and plastic toys isn't really about nostalgia or aesthetics—though natural wood is undeniably beautiful. It's about what serves your child best: toys that are safe to mouth, durable enough to last, engaging without being overwhelming, and honest about their materials.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Natural wooden toys offer something increasingly rare in modern childhood: simplicity that invites creativity, quality that endures, and materials that are exactly what they appear to be.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When you choose wooden toys from Poppa's Wooden Creations, you're choosing toys that will be part of your family's story for years to come—not clutter headed for landfill next season.

// BLOG POST: 5 Benefits of Wooden Toys
// ==========================================
const BenefitsWoodenToysContent: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <p className="mb-6">
      When you watch a child play with a beautifully crafted wooden toy, you're witnessing more than just entertainment. Those smooth curves of Kauri, the satisfying weight of Rimu, the simple elegance of handcrafted design—they're all contributing to your child's development in ways that might surprise you.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations in Whangarei, we've spent over a decade crafting wooden toys from native New Zealand timbers. After watching countless children play with our creations, and hearing from parents and educators across the country, we've seen these five benefits appear again and again.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      1. Superior Safety: Natural Materials Parents Can Trust
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every parent's first concern is safety, and wooden toys offer peace of mind that plastic simply cannot match.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Quality wooden toys contain no phthalates, BPA, PVC, or other chemicals common in plastic toys. When finished with food-safe natural oils—as all our toys at Poppa's are—they're completely safe for babies to mouth, chew, and explore. The wood itself is the product; there's nothing hidden beneath a coating, no synthetic materials that might leach or degrade.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Native New Zealand timbers like Rimu even have natural antibacterial properties, making them particularly suitable for teething toys and items that will inevitably spend time in little mouths.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Unlike plastic toys that can crack and create sharp edges, wooden toys wear gently. They might develop a patina over years of play, but they don't shatter, splinter (when properly crafted), or break into dangerous pieces.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      2. Sensory Development Through Natural Textures
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Babies and young children learn about their world primarily through touch. The varied textures of natural wooden toys provide rich sensory input that uniform plastic cannot match.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Each type of wood has its own character. Kauri has a different grain pattern than Rimu. Macrocarpa has its own unique feel. Even within a single piece, natural variations in the grain provide tactile information that helps develop your child's sensory processing abilities.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wood also has thermal properties plastic lacks. It feels warm to the touch, responding to body temperature in a way that helps children understand material properties. These may seem like small details, but they're exactly the kind of varied sensory input that builds neural connections in developing brains.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The weight of wooden toys provides important proprioceptive feedback too. When your toddler lifts, carries, or stacks wooden blocks, they're learning about weight, balance, and spatial relationships in ways that lightweight plastic toys simply cannot teach.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      3. Open-Ended Play That Builds Creativity
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The simplicity of wooden toys is their secret power. Without batteries, lights, or predetermined functions, they become whatever your child's imagination creates.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      A wooden vehicle isn't just a car. Today it might be an ambulance. Tomorrow, a delivery truck. Next week, part of an elaborate transport system your child invents entirely from imagination. That wooden block? It's a phone, a magic wand, a building, a bridge support, or whatever the moment requires.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This open-ended quality develops crucial cognitive skills. Children learn to think flexibly, to problem-solve, to create narratives, and to adapt materials to serve their purposes. Research in child development consistently shows that simple, open-ended toys promote more complex and creative play than feature-loaded alternatives.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Montessori educators have known this for over a century: the best toys are tools for imagination, not entertainment devices that do the imagining for the child.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      4. Durability That Lasts Generations
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This benefit has both practical and emotional dimensions. Practically speaking, a quality wooden toy will outlast a dozen plastic equivalents. Our customers regularly tell us about toys that have served multiple siblings, survived countless play sessions, and emerged barely worse for wear.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The average plastic toy breaks within 1-2 years. A well-crafted wooden toy—properly cared for—will last 50+ years. Some of our Kauri vehicles from the early days of Poppa's Wooden Creations are now being played with by the younger siblings of the children who first received them.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      But there's something deeper here too. When a toy lasts, it accumulates meaning. It becomes part of family stories. Children develop real attachments to toys that endure, toys that feel substantial and meaningful rather than disposable.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      There's a reason antique wooden toys are cherished and collectible, while plastic toys from even a decade ago are forgotten. Quality endures, and children intuitively understand the difference between real craftsmanship and disposable products.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      5. Environmental Responsibility Children Can See
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The environmental benefits of wooden toys are significant, but perhaps more importantly, they're teachable. Even young children can grasp the difference between a toy made from a tree and one made from petroleum byproducts.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden toys tell an honest story: sustainably harvested New Zealand timber, crafted by skilled hands in Whangarei, finished with natural oils, and completely biodegradable at end of life (though quality wooden toys rarely have an end of life—they just move to the next generation).
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When children play with natural materials, they're learning values that will serve them throughout life: quality over quantity, durability over disposability, natural over synthetic. These lessons aren't abstract—they're embedded in the very toys children hold and cherish.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Supporting local craftspeople matters too. When you choose wooden toys from Poppa's, you're supporting New Zealand craftsmanship and sustainable forestry practices rather than overseas manufacturing and long-distance shipping.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Cumulative Effect
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's what makes wooden toys truly special: these benefits don't exist in isolation. They work together, creating a play experience that's qualitatively different from what plastic toys offer.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Safe materials + rich sensory input + open-ended play + lasting quality + environmental consciousness = toys that support the kind of childhood we want for our kids. Childhood filled with creativity, exploration, and meaningful objects rather than disposable entertainment.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      We see it every time a child plays with one of our wooden vehicles or puzzles. The focused attention. The creative repurposing. The physical engagement with substantial, beautiful objects. The care children take with toys they recognize as special.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Making the Choice
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      You don't need to replace every plastic toy in your home overnight. But consider starting with a few quality wooden pieces—perhaps a set of blocks, a couple of vehicles, or some open-ended building materials.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Watch how your child plays with them. You might notice longer attention spans, more creative scenarios, different kinds of engagement. Many parents tell us that once they introduce quality wooden toys, their children naturally gravitate toward them over plastic alternatives.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations, every toy we craft is designed with these five benefits in mind. We choose native New Zealand timbers for their beauty and durability. We finish each piece by hand with food-safe oils. We keep designs simple to invite imagination. We build to last generations.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Because the toys children play with matter. They shape not just what children do, but how they learn to think, create, and engage with their world.
    </p>

// BLOG POST: How to Clean Wooden Toys
// ==========================================
const CleanWoodenToysContent: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <p className="mb-6">
      "Can I clean wooden toys?" It's one of the most common questions we hear at Poppa's Wooden Creations. Parents see their child's beloved wooden vehicle covered in sticky fingerprints or their teething ring after weeks of enthusiastic mouthing, and they worry that cleaning might damage these cherished items.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Good news: wooden toys are remarkably easy to clean and maintain. In fact, when properly cared for, they're more hygienic than many plastic alternatives. Here's everything you need to know about keeping your wooden toys clean, safe, and beautiful for generations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Wooden Toys Are Naturally Cleaner Than You Think
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Before we dive into cleaning methods, let's talk about why wooden toys are inherently more hygienic than plastic ones.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wood is a natural antimicrobial material. Studies have shown that certain bacteria that survive and multiply on plastic surfaces actually die on wood within hours. Native New Zealand timbers like Rimu—which we use extensively at Poppa's—have particularly strong natural antibacterial properties.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wood's porous structure draws moisture and bacteria into the material, where they become trapped and eventually die. Plastic's smooth, non-porous surface allows bacteria to sit on top and multiply. This is why professional chefs prefer wooden cutting boards over plastic ones.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      None of this means wooden toys don't need cleaning—they do. But it does mean you can clean them simply and naturally without harsh chemicals.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Daily Cleaning: The Simple Wipe-Down
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      For routine cleaning, simplicity is best:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Slightly dampen a clean cloth</strong> with plain water. The cloth should be damp, not wet—excess water is wooden toys' only real enemy.</li>
      <li><strong>Wipe down the toy</strong> to remove visible dirt, drool, or sticky residue.</li>
      <li><strong>Dry immediately</strong> with a clean, dry cloth. Don't let wooden toys air dry—always towel them off.</li>
      <li><strong>That's it.</strong> For daily maintenance, plain water is all you need.</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This simple process works for blocks, vehicles, puzzles, teething rings—essentially any wooden toy. It takes less than a minute and keeps toys clean without exposing your child to cleaning product residue.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Deep Cleaning: When Toys Need More Attention
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Sometimes toys need more thorough cleaning—perhaps after illness, or when they've accumulated grime that won't wipe away easily. Here's how to deep clean wooden toys safely:
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Method 1: Vinegar Solution (Best for Most Toys)
    </h3>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Mix equal parts white vinegar and water</li>
      <li>Dampen a cloth with this solution (don't soak it)</li>
      <li>Wipe down the toy thoroughly</li>
      <li>Follow immediately with a clean, damp cloth to remove vinegar residue</li>
      <li>Dry completely with a towel</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Vinegar is a natural disinfectant that's safe for wooden toys and completely non-toxic if any residue remains. The smell dissipates as it dries.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Method 2: Mild Soap Solution (For Stubborn Grime)
    </h3>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Add a tiny drop of mild, natural dish soap to a bowl of water</li>
      <li>Dampen your cloth (never submerge the toy)</li>
      <li>Wipe the toy clean</li>
      <li>Wipe again with a clean, damp cloth to remove all soap</li>
      <li>Dry immediately and thoroughly</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Use soap sparingly and rinse well—soap residue can damage wood's natural oils over time.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What NEVER to Do When Cleaning Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      These mistakes can damage or ruin wooden toys:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Never submerge wooden toys in water.</strong> Even sealed toys can absorb water through small cracks or joints, causing warping or splitting.</li>
      <li><strong>Never use harsh chemicals.</strong> Bleach, ammonia, and strong disinfectants can strip finishes, dry out wood, and leave toxic residue.</li>
      <li><strong>Never put wooden toys in the dishwasher.</strong> The high heat and prolonged water exposure will ruin them.</li>
      <li><strong>Never use abrasive scrubbers.</strong> Steel wool or rough sponges can scratch and damage smooth finishes.</li>
      <li><strong>Never let wooden toys stay wet.</strong> Always dry immediately after cleaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Maintaining the Natural Oil Finish
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      All our toys at Poppa's Wooden Creations are finished with food-safe natural oils. This finish protects the wood and keeps it looking beautiful, but over time and with cleaning, it needs refreshing.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every few months, or when the wood starts looking dry:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li>Clean the toy as usual and let it dry completely</li>
      <li>Apply a small amount of food-safe mineral oil, walnut oil, or beeswax to a soft cloth</li>
      <li>Rub the oil into the wood, following the grain</li>
      <li>Let it absorb for 10-15 minutes</li>
      <li>Buff off any excess with a clean cloth</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This simple maintenance keeps wooden toys looking beautiful and helps protect them from moisture and wear. The oil penetrates the wood, nourishing it from within—unlike paint or varnish, which sits on top and can chip or peel.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Special Situations: Teething Toys and Bath Time
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Cleaning Teething Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our Rimu teething rings get thoroughly mouthed—that's their job. Clean them more frequently:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Wipe down after each use</li>
      <li>Deep clean with vinegar solution weekly</li>
      <li>Refresh the oil monthly or when the wood looks dry</li>
      <li>Never use soap on teething toys—even food-safe soap can leave residue your baby will taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Wooden Toys and Water Play
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Can wooden toys get wet during play? Yes, briefly. Can they live in the bath? No.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      If a wooden toy gets wet during play, just dry it off promptly. Occasional splashes won't hurt. But don't use wooden toys as dedicated bath toys—prolonged water exposure will eventually damage even well-sealed wood.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Sanitizing After Illness
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      If your child has been sick and you want to sanitize their toys thoroughly:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li>Clean with the vinegar solution described above</li>
      <li>For extra sanitization, wipe with a cloth dampened with 3% hydrogen peroxide</li>
      <li>Let air dry completely (hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen)</li>
      <li>Refresh the oil finish afterward, as sanitizing can be slightly drying</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Remember, wood's natural antimicrobial properties mean it doesn't harbor bacteria the way plastic does. Combined with proper cleaning, wooden toys are actually more hygienic than plastic alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Long-Term Care: Keeping Wooden Toys Beautiful for Decades
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      With minimal care, quality wooden toys last generations. Here's what we recommend at Poppa's:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Store in a dry place.</strong> Avoid damp basements or humid bathrooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep out of direct sunlight.</strong> Extended sun exposure can fade natural wood colors.</li>
      <li><strong>Address damage promptly.</strong> A small ding is easy to smooth; ignored, it might splinter.</li>
      <li><strong>Refresh oil regularly.</strong> Well-oiled wood repels moisture and resists wear.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean gently and consistently.</strong> Regular light cleaning beats occasional harsh scrubbing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Bottom Line: Simple Care, Lasting Beauty
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Caring for wooden toys is simpler than most parents expect. No special products required, no complicated procedures. Just wipe clean, dry immediately, and occasionally refresh with natural oil.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This simplicity is one of wooden toys' great advantages. While plastic toys accumulate grime in molded crevices and trap moisture in battery compartments, wooden toys can be cleaned thoroughly with nothing but water and a cloth.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations, we build every toy to last. With the simple care practices outlined here, our handcrafted creations will serve your family for decades—looking beautiful, staying clean, and providing safe, engaging play for generations of children.

// BLOG POST: Montessori Wooden Toys for Babies
// ==========================================
const MontessoriWoodenToysForBabiesContent: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Walk into any Montessori nursery, and you'll notice something immediately: no flashing lights, no electronic sounds, no plastic clutter. Instead, you'll see carefully selected wooden toys that seem almost too simple. A few blocks. Some vehicles. Natural materials arranged thoughtfully.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This isn't minimalism for aesthetics' sake. It's based on over a century of observation about how babies actually learn. At Poppa's Wooden Creations in Whangarei, we craft toys that embody these Montessori principles—toys that respect babies' intelligence while supporting their natural development.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's what you need to know about choosing Montessori wooden toys for your baby, and why these simple objects are actually profound learning tools.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What Makes a Toy "Montessori"?
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Montessori isn't a brand or a specific set of products. It's an approach to learning that honors how children naturally develop. When applied to toys, Montessori principles translate into specific characteristics:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Reality-based:</strong> Toys represent real objects (cars, animals, tools) rather than fantasy characters</li>
      <li><strong>Natural materials:</strong> Wood, metal, fabric instead of plastic</li>
      <li><strong>Functional:</strong> Objects that work like real things (wheels that actually roll, doors that open)</li>
      <li><strong>Open-ended:</strong> No single "correct" way to play</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriately simple:</strong> Not overstimulating, allowing focus</li>
      <li><strong>Aesthetically beautiful:</strong> Quality craftsmanship that communicates respect</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Notice what's absent: batteries, electronics, predetermined sequences, multiple functions in one toy. Montessori toys do one thing well rather than many things poorly.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Wood? The Montessori Perspective on Materials
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Maria Montessori believed children should experience authentic materials from the beginning. Wood isn't just aesthetically pleasing—it provides sensory information plastic cannot match.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wood has weight, warmth, varied texture, and natural beauty. When a baby grasps a wooden rattle, they're learning that different objects have different properties. The weight of our Kauri teething ring teaches something different than our lighter Macrocarpa blocks would.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      These subtle variations in tactile experience help babies develop sensory discrimination—the ability to notice and process differences in their environment. This foundational skill supports everything from motor development to later academic learning.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plus, as any Montessori educator will tell you: babies deserve real things. Not imitations, not synthetic substitutes. Real wood, real craftsmanship, real beauty.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Birth to 6 Months: The Foundation
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      In the first months, babies are developing basic motor control and sensory awareness. Montessori wooden toys for this stage support these foundational developments.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Grasping Rings
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Simple wooden rings are often a baby's first toy. They're sized for tiny hands to grasp, light enough for developing muscles to lift, and safe to mouth. Our Rimu grasping rings have smooth curves that feel good in little hands and provide the perfect first "I can hold this!" experience.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Wooden Rattles
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      A rattle teaches cause and effect: I shake, it makes sound. But Montessori rattles are different from typical plastic ones. The sound is gentle—wood clicking softly rather than harsh jingling. This subtle feedback encourages babies to listen carefully rather than becoming overstimulated.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Teething Rings
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When everything goes in the mouth, you want pure materials. Our handcrafted teething rings from Rimu wood provide safe, chemical-free relief for sore gums. The natural antibacterial properties of Rimu make it particularly suitable for toys that will be constantly mouthed.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      6-12 Months: Exploration and Intention
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      As babies become mobile and more intentional in their movements, their toys can become slightly more complex—though still beautifully simple.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Object Permanence Box
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This classic Montessori material teaches that objects continue to exist even when you can't see them—a crucial cognitive milestone. A ball goes in a hole and appears again. The simple action, repeated countless times, builds understanding.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Simple Push Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      As babies learn to crawl, simple wooden vehicles that actually roll encourage movement and teach cause and effect. Our handcrafted baby toy cars are sized perfectly for small hands and move smoothly with just a gentle push.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Nesting and Stacking Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      These teach size relationships, spatial awareness, and problem-solving. Wooden versions provide weight feedback that helps babies understand when they've successfully stacked or nested pieces.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      12-18 Months: Building Skills
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Toddlers are ready for slightly more challenging materials that still respect Montessori principles of simplicity and natural beauty.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Simple Puzzles
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden puzzles with large knobs teach problem-solving and fine motor skills. Montessori puzzles typically show one concept: shapes, animals, or vehicles. Each puzzle teaches something specific rather than overwhelming with multiple elements.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Building Blocks
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      A set of natural wooden blocks is perhaps the ultimate Montessori toy. No instructions, no limits. Just beautiful pieces of wood that can become anything imagination creates. Our handcrafted block sets use varied native New Zealand timbers, so each block has its own character.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Push and Pull Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      As walking becomes confident, push and pull toys encourage movement. Our wooden trolleys serve double duty—providing support for new walkers while offering space to transport treasured blocks and toys.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What Montessori Toys Don't Do
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Understanding Montessori principles means recognizing what's intentionally absent:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>No batteries or electronics:</strong> These do the work for the child rather than encouraging active engagement</li>
      <li><strong>No multiple functions:</strong> A toy that's also a phone, also a learning device, also plays music is overstimulating and confusing</li>
      <li><strong>No fantasy characters:</strong> Babies benefit from understanding real objects first</li>
      <li><strong>No overstimulation:</strong> Flashing lights and loud sounds interrupt concentration</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This might sound restrictive, but parents consistently report that babies play longer and more contentedly with simple wooden toys than with feature-loaded alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The "Fewer, Better" Philosophy
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      One of Montessori's key insights: children focus better with fewer choices. Instead of a toy box overflowing with plastic, Montessori environments offer a small selection of beautiful objects, rotated periodically to maintain interest.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      For babies, this might mean:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>5-8 toys available at once</li>
      <li>Displayed on low shelves where baby can see and choose</li>
      <li>Each toy has a specific place</li>
      <li>Toys are rotated every few weeks</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Quality wooden toys support this approach beautifully. They're attractive enough to display, durable enough to handle rotation and storage, and engaging enough that a few good pieces provide more play value than dozens of plastic alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Safety in Simplicity
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Montessori toys are safe not despite their simplicity but because of it. No small batteries to swallow, no electronic components to break and expose sharp edges, no painted finishes to chip and flake.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's, we finish all our baby toys with food-safe natural oils. Nothing to worry about when (not if) the toy goes in the mouth. The wood itself—particularly native New Zealand timbers like Rimu—has natural antibacterial properties.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Each toy is handcrafted and carefully sanded smooth. No rough edges, no splinters, no compromises on safety. The simple construction means there's nothing to break off or come loose.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Building a Montessori Toy Collection
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      You don't need everything at once. Start with a few key pieces:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>A teething toy:</strong> Safe, natural, soothing</li>
      <li><strong>Something to grasp:</strong> Develops motor skills and coordination</li>
      <li><strong>A simple vehicle:</strong> Teaches cause and effect, encourages movement</li>
      <li><strong>Some blocks:</strong> Open-ended, grows with your child</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Add pieces gradually as your baby develops and shows interest. This measured approach respects both your budget and Montessori principles about thoughtful simplicity.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What Parents Notice
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Parents who transition to Montessori wooden toys often report:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Babies play for longer periods without needing intervention</li>
      <li>Less toy-related frustration (simple toys don't have complex mechanisms to figure out)</li>
      <li>More creative play as babies get older</li>
      <li>Peaceful play environments without electronic noise</li>
      <li>Toys they feel good about displaying in their homes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Long View
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's what makes Montessori wooden toys a genuine investment: they grow with your child. Those blocks your baby mouths at six months? Still engaging at age five for building complex structures. The simple vehicle they push around as a toddler? Part of elaborate imaginative scenarios years later.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Quality wooden toys don't become obsolete. They don't rely on developmental stages or batteries or your child's current interests. They're tools for learning and creativity that remain relevant through years of childhood.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations, we craft every toy with this longevity in mind. Native New Zealand timber, careful construction, timeless design. These aren't disposable entertainment—they're childhood companions built to last.

    <p className="mb-6">
      Your baby is born ready to learn. Every touch, sound, sight, and texture builds neural pathways that form the foundation for all future development. In those crucial first months and years, sensory experiences aren't just pleasant—they're essential for brain development.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations in Whangarei, we understand that toys aren't just for play—they're tools for learning. Our handcrafted wooden toys from native New Zealand timbers provide the rich sensory experiences babies need. Here's your complete guide to choosing sensory wooden toys that support your baby's development.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Sensory Development Matters
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Babies learn about their world through their senses. Before they can talk or walk, they're gathering information through touch, sight, sound, taste, and movement. Each sensory experience creates connections in the developing brain.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rich, varied sensory input in early childhood leads to:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Better motor skill development</li>
      <li>Enhanced cognitive abilities</li>
      <li>Improved attention and focus</li>
      <li>Stronger language development</li>
      <li>Greater emotional regulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The toys you choose matter because they're delivering that crucial sensory input dozens of times each day.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Wood Is Superior for Sensory Development
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Plastic toys feel uniform. Every plastic rattle, block, or car has essentially the same smooth, synthetic texture and similar weight. Your baby's brain processes this as: "plastic object."
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden toys provide varied sensory input with every interaction:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Tactile variety:</strong> Wood grain creates natural texture variations</li>
      <li><strong>Weight differences:</strong> Kauri feels different from Rimu, which differs from Macrocarpa</li>
      <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Wood responds to body heat, feeling warm and alive rather than cold and synthetic</li>
      <li><strong>Acoustic properties:</strong> Wood makes gentler, more varied sounds than plastic</li>
      <li><strong>Visual interest:</strong> Natural grain patterns and color variations engage developing vision</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      These subtle differences might seem minor to adults, but to a baby's developing brain, they're profound. Each variation helps build sensory discrimination—the ability to notice and process differences.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Five Senses and Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Touch (Tactile Development)
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Touch is perhaps the most crucial sense in early development. Babies literally learn through their hands (and mouths).
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>What wooden toys provide:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Natural grain texture that provides tactile feedback</li>
      <li>Varied surface finishes (smooth sanded wood, natural oil finish)</li>
      <li>Different hardnesses (some woods are harder than others)</li>
      <li>Appropriate resistance when grasping</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our teething rings exemplify this. The smooth, oiled Rimu provides relief for sore gums while giving rich tactile information. The wood's warmth, the grain's subtle texture, the ring's weight—all contribute to sensory development.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Sight (Visual Development)
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Babies' vision develops rapidly in the first year. They need visual stimulation, but not overstimulation.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>What wooden toys provide:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Natural color variations in wood grain</li>
      <li>Contrasting wood tones (light Kauri vs. dark Rimu)</li>
      <li>Simple, clear shapes easy for developing vision to process</li>
      <li>No flashing lights that can overstimulate</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The natural beauty of wood provides visual interest without overwhelming babies' developing visual systems.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Sound (Auditory Development)
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Babies need to learn to discriminate between different sounds—a skill crucial for language development.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>What wooden toys provide:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Gentle clicking sounds when pieces touch</li>
      <li>Varied tones depending on wood type and size</li>
      <li>Natural acoustic properties that aren't harsh</li>
      <li>Sounds that encourage listening rather than tuning out</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Unlike electronic toys with programmed sounds at fixed volumes, wooden toys make sounds proportional to how the baby interacts with them—teaching cause and effect while developing auditory discrimination.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Proprioception (Body Awareness)
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This often-overlooked sense tells us where our bodies are in space. It's crucial for motor development.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>What wooden toys provide:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Appropriate weight that develops muscle strength</li>
      <li>Resistance when stacking or building</li>
      <li>Feedback when objects are lifted, pushed, or pulled</li>
      <li>Real consequences (blocks fall if not balanced properly)</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The substantial weight of wooden toys—compared to lightweight plastic—helps babies develop body awareness and motor control.
    </p>

      Best Sensory Wooden Toys by Age
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      0-6 Months: First Sensory Experiences
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At this stage, babies are developing basic motor control and sensory awareness.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>Best toys:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Wooden teething rings:</strong> Smooth, safe to mouth, provides relief and sensory input</li>
      <li><strong>Simple grasping toys:</strong> Sized for tiny hands, light enough to lift</li>
      <li><strong>Gentle rattles:</strong> Teaches cause and effect with soft, natural sounds</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Look for pieces that are easy to grasp, safe to mouth, and made from a single piece of wood (no small parts).
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      6-12 Months: Active Exploration
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Babies are now mobile and actively exploring everything they can reach.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>Best toys:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">

      <li><strong>First blocks:</strong> For grasping, mouthing, and early stacking attempts</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our handcrafted baby toy cars are perfect for this stage—smooth rolling action, appropriate size for little hands, and varied native timbers for sensory variety.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      12-24 Months: Complex Manipulation
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Toddlers have much better motor control and are ready for more complex sensory challenges.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>Best toys:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">

      <li><strong>Simple puzzles:</strong> Develop problem-solving and fine motor skills</li>
      <li><strong>Push and pull toys:</strong> Encourage movement and provide proprioceptive feedback</li>
      <li><strong>Nesting toys:</strong> Teach size relationships and spatial reasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our wooden trolley and blocks set exemplifies multi-sensory learning—the trolley provides gross motor development while the blocks offer endless fine motor and cognitive challenges.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What to Look for in Quality Sensory Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Not all wooden toys provide equal sensory value. Here's what makes the difference:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Varied wood types:</strong> Using different native timbers provides natural sensory variety</li>
      <li><strong>Natural finishes:</strong> Oil-finished wood retains tactile properties; thick paint masks them</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriate weight:</strong> Heavy enough to provide feedback, light enough for small hands</li>
      <li><strong>Smooth construction:</strong> No splinters, but grain texture still evident</li>
      <li><strong>Simple design:</strong> Sensory focus rather than visual distraction</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's, we deliberately use varied native New Zealand timbers in our toys. A set of blocks might include Kauri, Rimu, and Macrocarpa—each providing different sensory information.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Sensory Play Activities with Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Enhance the sensory value of wooden toys with simple activities:
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Texture Exploration
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Let your baby feel the difference between smooth sanded wood and natural grain. Run their hands along different wood types, naming them as you go.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Weight Comparison
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Give your toddler two blocks of different woods. Let them discover that one is heavier than the other. This builds understanding of physical properties.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Sound Discovery
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Let your baby discover that wooden toys make different sounds when tapped together, dropped on different surfaces, or rolled across floors.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Red Flags: What to Avoid
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Some toys marketed as "sensory" actually provide poor sensory input:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Overpainted wood:</strong> Thick paint masks wood's natural sensory properties</li>
      <li><strong>Plywood or composite:</strong> Lacks the natural variation of solid wood</li>
      <li><strong>Electronic additions:</strong> Buttons and sounds distract from natural sensory exploration</li>
      <li><strong>Too light or too heavy:</strong> Doesn't provide appropriate feedback for the age group</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Long-Term Benefits
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Investing in quality sensory toys pays dividends far beyond babyhood. Children who receive rich sensory input in early years show:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Better fine motor skills (helping with writing, drawing, self-care)</li>
      <li>Enhanced focus and attention</li>
      <li>Stronger problem-solving abilities</li>
      <li>Greater emotional regulation</li>
      <li>More confident physical movement</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      These aren't abstract benefits—they're practical skills that support every aspect of development and learning.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Starting Your Sensory Toy Collection
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      You don't need everything at once. Start with:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>One teething toy (for tactile and oral sensory input)</li>
      <li>One vehicle (for visual tracking and cause-effect learning)</li>
      <li>A small set of blocks (for versatile sensory and cognitive development)</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Build from there as your baby develops and shows interest. Quality over quantity always wins—a few excellent sensory toys provide more developmental value than dozens of mediocre ones.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">

    <p className="mb-6">
      If you're a parent with a teething baby, you know the struggle. Your little one is uncomfortable, fussy, and putting absolutely everything in their mouth. You want to help, but you're also conscious about what materials are going near those delicate gums.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      At Poppa's Wooden Creations in Whangarei, our handcrafted Rimu teething rings have become a trusted solution for parents across New Zealand. Carved from a single piece of native Rimu and finished with food-safe oil, they provide natural, chemical-free relief while being beautiful enough to become a treasured keepsake.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's everything you need to know about why Rimu makes the perfect teething toy, and what makes our handcrafted rings special.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Rimu? The Natural Choice for Teething
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Not all woods are suitable for teething toys. Rimu—a native New Zealand timber—has properties that make it particularly ideal for babies.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Natural Antibacterial Properties
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rimu contains natural tannins that give it antibacterial properties. While this doesn't replace regular cleaning, it means the wood naturally resists bacterial growth better than plastic or other materials.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Perfect Hardness
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rimu is hard enough to be durable and safe (it won't splinter), but not so hard that it's uncomfortable for sore gums. The density provides satisfying resistance when babies chew while being gentle enough for delicate mouths.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Beautiful Natural Grain
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rimu has a distinctive reddish-brown color with rich grain patterns. Each teething ring is unique—no two pieces of wood are exactly alike. This natural beauty means you'll actually want to keep this teething toy as a memento long after the teething phase passes.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Sustainably Harvested in New Zealand
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      All our Rimu comes from sustainably managed New Zealand sources. You're giving your baby a natural, local product rather than imported plastic made from petroleum.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Problem with Plastic Teethers
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Most commercial teething toys are made from plastic, silicone, or rubber. While many claim to be "BPA-free," that doesn't mean they're chemical-free.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Common issues with plastic teethers:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Hidden chemicals:</strong> Even BPA-free plastics can contain concerning substitutes</li>
      <li><strong>Durability concerns:</strong> Plastic can crack, creating rough edges or exposing internal materials</li>
      <li><strong>Bacterial growth:</strong> Plastic's smooth surface allows bacteria to multiply on top</li>
      <li><strong>Synthetic feel:</strong> Cold, uniform texture provides limited sensory input</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Petroleum-based, non-biodegradable</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When your baby is going through one of the most oral phases of development, putting things in their mouth dozens of times daily, materials matter.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      How Our Teething Rings Are Made
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every teething ring we create at Poppa's Wooden Creations is handcrafted in our Whangarei workshop. Here's our process:
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      1. Wood Selection
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      We carefully select pieces of Rimu for grain quality and natural beauty. Each piece is inspected for defects or weaknesses.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      2. Shaping
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The ring is carved from a single piece of wood—no joints, no glue, no weak points. This one-piece construction ensures durability and safety.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      3. Sanding
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This is where craftsmanship matters most. We sand each ring through progressively finer grits until it's perfectly smooth. No rough edges, no splinters—just silky-smooth wood that's safe for the most delicate gums.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      4. Food-Safe Oil Finish
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      We finish each ring with food-grade oil that's completely safe for babies to mouth. This finish brings out Rimu's natural color and grain while protecting the wood. No varnishes, no toxic finishes, nothing you need to worry about.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      5. Final Inspection
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every ring is personally inspected before leaving our workshop. We're not satisfied unless it meets our standards for safety, smoothness, and beauty.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why the Design Matters
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our teething rings aren't just circles. The design is intentional:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Perfect size:</strong> Large enough to be safe (can't be swallowed), small enough for tiny hands to grasp</li>
      <li><strong>Appropriate thickness:</strong> Comfortable for babies to grip and chew</li>
      <li><strong>Smooth edges:</strong> Comfortable against lips and gums</li>
      <li><strong>Substantial weight:</strong> Heavy enough to feel real and provide proprioceptive feedback, light enough for babies to hold</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Simple, yes. But simple done right, with careful attention to how babies actually use teething toys.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Sensory Benefits
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      A teething ring isn't just for gum relief—it's also a developmental tool. Wooden teething rings provide rich sensory input:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Tactile stimulation:</strong> Natural grain texture stimulates developing touch receptors</li>
      <li><strong>Oral sensory input:</strong> The wood's warmth and natural feel help babies understand material properties</li>
      <li><strong>Motor development:</strong> Grasping and manipulating the ring builds hand strength and coordination</li>
      <li><strong>Visual interest:</strong> Natural wood grain and color provide something interesting to look at</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every interaction is a learning experience, even when your baby is just seeking comfort for sore gums.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Caring for Your Rimu Teething Ring
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Wooden teething toys require minimal care:
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Daily Cleaning
    </h3>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Wipe with a damp cloth after each use</li>
      <li>Dry immediately with a clean towel</li>
      <li>That's it for routine cleaning</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Deep Cleaning
    </h3>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Use equal parts white vinegar and water on a damp cloth</li>
      <li>Wipe the ring thoroughly</li>
      <li>Follow with a clean, damp cloth to remove vinegar</li>
      <li>Dry completely</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
      Oil Refresh (Every Few Weeks)
    </h3>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Apply a small amount of food-safe mineral oil</li>
      <li>Rub in with a soft cloth</li>
      <li>Let absorb for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Buff off excess</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>Never:</strong> Submerge in water, put in dishwasher, use harsh chemicals, or leave wet.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Safety Standards and Testing
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Safety is our absolute priority. Our teething rings meet or exceed relevant safety standards:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>One-piece construction eliminates choking hazard from loose parts</li>
      <li>Size exceeds minimum dimensions to prevent swallowing</li>
      <li>Food-safe oil finish is non-toxic and safe for oral contact</li>
      <li>Smooth finish eliminates splinter risk</li>
      <li>Durable construction withstands vigorous chewing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      When to Start Using a Teething Ring
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Most babies start teething between 4-7 months, but signs can appear earlier:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Excessive drooling</li>
      <li>Chewing on hands or objects</li>
      <li>Irritability or fussiness</li>
      <li>Disrupted sleep</li>
      <li>Swollen or tender gums</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Once your baby can grasp objects (usually around 3-4 months), they can start using a teething ring. The ring provides relief while also serving as a safe, engaging toy for developing motor skills.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      What Parents Tell Us
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Parents who choose our Rimu teething rings consistently mention:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>"I love knowing exactly what materials are going in my baby's mouth"</li>
      <li>"It's beautiful enough to display even when not in use"</li>
      <li>"My baby actually prefers it over plastic teethers"</li>
      <li>"It's held up perfectly through two children"</li>
      <li>"I'm keeping it as a memento of the baby stage"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Beyond Teething: A Lasting Keepsake
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Here's something unexpected: many parents keep our teething rings long after their children have finished teething.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The natural beauty of Rimu, combined with memories of comforting a teething baby, transforms these functional objects into cherished keepsakes. Some parents display them in memory boxes. Others pass them down to younger siblings, or even save them for future grandchildren.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Unlike disposable plastic teethers that go straight to landfill, a handcrafted wooden teething ring becomes part of your family's story.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Why Choose Handcrafted Over Mass-Produced?

    <p className="mb-6">
      Mass-produced teething toys prioritize cost over quality. They're made in large factories using the cheapest possible materials and processes.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our handcrafted approach means:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Every piece is individually crafted and inspected</li>
      <li>Native NZ timber instead of imported softwood</li>
      <li>Food-safe finish applied by hand</li>
      <li>Quality control that's personal, not statistical</li>
      <li>Supporting local NZ craftsmanship</li>
      <li>A unique piece that's never exactly like another</li>
    </ul>

    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">

      <li>Beautiful and giftable</li>
      <li>Safe and natural</li>
      <li>Made in New Zealand</li>
      <li>Likely to become a keepsake</li>
      <li>Shows you put thought into the gift</li>
    </ul>
