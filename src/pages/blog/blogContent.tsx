      Why Whangarei-Made Wooden Toys Stand Out
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Nestled in the heart of Northland, Whangarei has become home to some of New Zealand's finest handcrafted wooden toys. At Poppa's Wooden Creations, we've been crafting heirloom-quality toys from native timber since 2015, combining traditional woodworking techniques with modern safety standards.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our Whangarei workshop specializes in creating toys that tell a story. Each piece is individually handcrafted using sustainably sourced native New Zealand timbers, primarily Kauri, Rimu, and Macrocarpa. These timbers aren't just beautiful – they're incredibly durable and carry the natural warmth that only genuine New Zealand wood can provide.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Unlike mass-produced plastic toys, our handmade creations are designed to last generations. We've had customers pass down toys to grandchildren, with the wood developing a rich patina that adds character over time.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      The Magic of Native New Zealand Timber
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Kauri: The Premium Choice
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Kauri is one of New Zealand's most prized native timbers, known for its fine grain and warm golden color. Toys crafted from Kauri are remarkably lightweight yet incredibly strong, making them perfect for little hands to grip and play with. The natural oils in Kauri also provide a subtle, pleasant aroma that parents love.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Rimu: Rich and Distinctive
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rimu offers a stunning reddish-brown hue that darkens beautifully with age. This timber is slightly heavier than Kauri, giving toys a satisfying weight and durability. Rimu's distinctive grain patterns mean no two toys are ever exactly alike – each piece is truly one-of-a-kind.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Macrocarpa: Sustainable and Beautiful
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Macrocarpa is our sustainable choice for families seeking eco-friendly options. This fast-growing timber features a lovely pale yellow color and excellent workability, allowing us to create intricate details in toy designs. It's particularly popular for our baby toys due to its smooth finish and non-toxic properties.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Our Most Popular Whangarei-Made Toys
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Wooden Toy Trucks and Cars
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our fleet of wooden vehicles has been delighting Kiwi kids for years. From fire trucks to logging trucks, each vehicle is carefully shaped from a single piece of timber, ensuring durability during intense play sessions. The natural weight of the wood gives these toys a realistic feel that plastic simply cannot match.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Montessori-Aligned Educational Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      We've partnered with Montessori schools across New Zealand to create toys that support developmental milestones. Our wooden puzzles, stacking toys, and shape sorters are designed to encourage problem-solving, fine motor skills, and independent play – all key principles of Montessori education.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Heirloom Kitchen Utensils and Serving Boards
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      While known primarily for toys, our workshop also produces stunning kitchen pieces. Cheese boards, cutting boards, and wooden spoons crafted from native timber make exceptional gifts that combine functionality with natural beauty. Many families display these pieces as art when not in use.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      The Handcrafting Process
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every toy begins as a carefully selected piece of timber. We inspect each board for grain quality, ensuring there are no hidden flaws that could compromise safety or durability. From there, the wood is shaped using traditional woodworking tools, sanded smooth to a buttery finish, and treated with food-safe, non-toxic oils.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The entire process is done by hand in our Whangarei workshop. This attention to detail means production is slower than factory manufacturing, but the result is incomparable quality. Each toy undergoes rigorous safety checks before it reaches your family.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Safety Standards That Matter
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      All our wooden toys meet or exceed New Zealand toy safety standards. We use only non-toxic, food-safe finishes – important because we know little ones explore the world with their mouths. There are no small parts, sharp edges, or toxic chemicals in any of our creations.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The natural antimicrobial properties of native New Zealand timbers also provide an added safety benefit. Wood naturally resists bacteria growth, making our toys more hygienic than plastic alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Supporting Local Whangarei Craftsmanship
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When you choose Poppa's Wooden Creations, you're supporting local Northland craftsmanship and sustainable forestry practices. We source our timber from responsibly managed forests and prioritize using reclaimed wood whenever possible. This commitment to sustainability ensures native New Zealand forests are protected for future generations.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our workshop employs traditional joinery techniques passed down through generations of Kiwi woodworkers. By choosing handmade over mass-produced, you're helping preserve these valuable skills and supporting the local Whangarei economy.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Perfect for Every Occasion
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">

    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">

    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Many customers tell us our toys become family treasures, with children remembering specific pieces well into adulthood. There's something deeply special about a toy that carries memories and can be passed down through generations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Caring for Your Whangarei-Made Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Maintaining wooden toys is simple. Wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap when needed, then dry thoroughly. Avoid soaking in water or putting in dishwashers. Occasionally treat with food-safe mineral oil to maintain the wood's natural luster.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Proper care ensures your handcrafted toys will last for decades, developing a beautiful patina that tells the story of countless play sessions and childhood adventures.

    <p className="mb-6">
      New Zealand's ancient Kauri forests have gifted us with one of the world's most remarkable timbers—and it's revolutionizing how we think about children's toys. For parents seeking alternatives to plastic playthings, Kauri wood offers something extraordinary: a material that combines exceptional durability with natural beauty and a legacy that spans generations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Built to Last: The Durability Advantage
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When a wooden toy car tumbles down the stairs for the third time this week, you'll appreciate what makes Kauri special. This magnificent native timber possesses incredible strength and resistance to wear, outlasting softer woods and plastics by decades. A Kauri dump truck that delights your toddler today will still be rolling strong when they're passing it down to their own children.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The timber's density creates toys that feel substantial in small hands—solid, balanced, and reassuring. Unlike mass-produced alternatives that splinter or crack, properly crafted Kauri toy vehicles withstand the enthusiastic play that childhood demands. Fewer breakages mean safer play environments and toys that truly earn the title "heirloom quality."
    </p>

        Premium Kauri timber showcasing the natural grain and craftsmanship that defines New Zealand wooden toys
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Natural Beauty in Every Grain
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Each piece of Kauri tells a story through its distinctive grain patterns and warm honey tones. When artisans at Poppa's Wooden Creations select timber for a handmade car toy, they're choosing wood with character—no two pieces identical, each bearing the unique signature of New Zealand's ancient forests.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This natural aesthetic creates a sensory richness that plastic simply cannot replicate. The smooth finish invites touch, the subtle wood grain engages developing eyes, and the solid weight provides tactile feedback that supports sensory development. These aren't just toys; they're connections to the natural world, bringing organic beauty into the playroom.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Sustainability Meets Heritage
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Choosing Kauri wood for children's toys represents a commitment beyond quality—it's an investment in environmental responsibility. When responsibly sourced, this local timber supports sustainable forestry practices and reduces the carbon footprint associated with imported materials or petroleum-based plastics.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The eco-friendly wooden toys crafted from NZ Kauri also preserve traditional woodworking skills and support local artisans. Every wooden toy car made in New Zealand keeps these crafts alive for future generations, creating economic sustainability alongside environmental stewardship.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Safety Factor Often Overlooked
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Beyond durability and beauty, Kauri offers inherent safety advantages. The wood's naturally antimicrobial properties create a healthier play surface—particularly important for toys that inevitably end up in young mouths. Unlike plastics that may contain questionable chemicals or require synthetic finishes, properly treated Kauri provides a non-toxic alternative where safety and health are paramount.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The timber's stability also means fewer splinters and a smooth finish that remains consistent through years of handling, washing, and play.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      An Investment in Timeless Play
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Consider the lifecycle of a typical plastic toy vehicle: a few months of play, perhaps a year if you're lucky, then off to the landfill. Now imagine a beautifully crafted Kauri wooden toy car—solid, smooth, ready for endless imaginative journeys—that moves seamlessly from child to grandchild, accumulating stories and memories along the way.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This is the promise of New Zealand wooden toys crafted from Kauri: playthings that transcend trends, resist obsolescence, and gain value through the years. They represent a different philosophy of childhood—one where fewer, better-made items foster deeper engagement and more meaningful play.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Choosing Quality That Endures
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The decision to choose Kauri wood for children's toys isn't merely about selecting a material—it's about embracing values. It's choosing durability over disposability, natural beauty over synthetic uniformity, and sustainable craftsmanship over mass production.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      From a simple wooden toy car to an elaborate collection of toy vehicles, Kauri wood transforms play into an experience steeped in natural beauty and enduring value. When you invest in New Zealand wooden toys made from this premium timber, you're not just buying a toy—you're passing down a piece of heritage, a connection to ancient forests, and a commitment to quality that will outlast childhood itself.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      <strong>Give your child something that matters. Choose Kauri.</strong>
