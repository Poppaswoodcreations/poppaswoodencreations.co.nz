      Why Whangarei-Made Wooden Toys Stand Out
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Nestled in the heart of Northland, Whangarei has become home to some of New Zealand's finest handcrafted wooden toys. At Poppa's Wooden Creations, we've been crafting heirloom-quality toys from native timber since 2015, combining traditional woodworking techniques with modern safety standards.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our Whangarei workshop specializes in creating toys that tell a story. Each piece is individually handcrafted using sustainably sourced native New Zealand timbers, primarily Kauri, Rimu, and Macrocarpa. These timbers aren't just beautiful – they're incredibly durable and carry the natural warmth that only genuine New Zealand wood can provide.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Unlike mass-produced plastic toys, our handmade creations are designed to last generations. We've had customers pass down toys to grandchildren, with the wood developing a rich patina that adds character over time.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      The Magic of Native New Zealand Timber
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Kauri: The Premium Choice
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Kauri is one of New Zealand's most prized native timbers, known for its fine grain and warm golden color. Toys crafted from Kauri are remarkably lightweight yet incredibly strong, making them perfect for little hands to grip and play with. The natural oils in Kauri also provide a subtle, pleasant aroma that parents love.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Rimu: Rich and Distinctive
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Rimu offers a stunning reddish-brown hue that darkens beautifully with age. This timber is slightly heavier than Kauri, giving toys a satisfying weight and durability. Rimu's distinctive grain patterns mean no two toys are ever exactly alike – each piece is truly one-of-a-kind.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Macrocarpa: Sustainable and Beautiful
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Macrocarpa is our sustainable choice for families seeking eco-friendly options. This fast-growing timber features a lovely pale yellow color and excellent workability, allowing us to create intricate details in toy designs. It's particularly popular for our baby toys due to its smooth finish and non-toxic properties.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Our Most Popular Whangarei-Made Toys
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Wooden Toy Trucks and Cars
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our fleet of wooden vehicles has been delighting Kiwi kids for years. From fire trucks to logging trucks, each vehicle is carefully shaped from a single piece of timber, ensuring durability during intense play sessions. The natural weight of the wood gives these toys a realistic feel that plastic simply cannot match.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Montessori-Aligned Educational Toys
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      We've partnered with Montessori schools across New Zealand to create toys that support developmental milestones. Our wooden puzzles, stacking toys, and shape sorters are designed to encourage problem-solving, fine motor skills, and independent play – all key principles of Montessori education.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
      Heirloom Kitchen Utensils and Serving Boards
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      While known primarily for toys, our workshop also produces stunning kitchen pieces. Cheese boards, cutting boards, and wooden spoons crafted from native timber make exceptional gifts that combine functionality with natural beauty. Many families display these pieces as art when not in use.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      The Handcrafting Process
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Every toy begins as a carefully selected piece of timber. We inspect each board for grain quality, ensuring there are no hidden flaws that could compromise safety or durability. From there, the wood is shaped using traditional woodworking tools, sanded smooth to a buttery finish, and treated with food-safe, non-toxic oils.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The entire process is done by hand in our Whangarei workshop. This attention to detail means production is slower than factory manufacturing, but the result is incomparable quality. Each toy undergoes rigorous safety checks before it reaches your family.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Safety Standards That Matter
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      All our wooden toys meet or exceed New Zealand toy safety standards. We use only non-toxic, food-safe finishes – important because we know little ones explore the world with their mouths. There are no small parts, sharp edges, or toxic chemicals in any of our creations.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The natural antimicrobial properties of native New Zealand timbers also provide an added safety benefit. Wood naturally resists bacteria growth, making our toys more hygienic than plastic alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Supporting Local Whangarei Craftsmanship
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      When you choose Poppa's Wooden Creations, you're supporting local Northland craftsmanship and sustainable forestry practices. We source our timber from responsibly managed forests and prioritize using reclaimed wood whenever possible. This commitment to sustainability ensures native New Zealand forests are protected for future generations.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our workshop employs traditional joinery techniques passed down through generations of Kiwi woodworkers. By choosing handmade over mass-produced, you're helping preserve these valuable skills and supporting the local Whangarei economy.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Perfect for Every Occasion
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Our wooden toys make exceptional gifts for:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">

      <li>Grandparents looking for meaningful, lasting gifts</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Many customers tell us our toys become family treasures, with children remembering specific pieces well into adulthood. There's something deeply special about a toy that carries memories and can be passed down through generations.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
      Caring for Your Whangarei-Made Wooden Toys
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Maintaining wooden toys is simple. Wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap when needed, then dry thoroughly. Avoid soaking in water or putting in dishwashers. Occasionally treat with food-safe mineral oil to maintain the wood's natural luster.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Proper care ensures your handcrafted toys will last for decades, developing a beautiful patina that tells the story of countless play sessions and childhood adventures.
