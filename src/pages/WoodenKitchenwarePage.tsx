        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our wooden kitchenware is handcrafted in Whangarei from native New Zealand timbers — primarily Rimu and Macrocarpa. Every bowl, board, and utensil is shaped and finished entirely by hand in our Tikipunga workshop, creating pieces that are as beautiful to look at as they are functional to use.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Handcrafted wooden kitchenware is in a different class entirely from mass-produced alternatives. The natural grain of New Zealand native timber, the warmth of a hand-applied oil finish, and the subtle variations that come from genuine handwork make each piece genuinely unique — a functional work of art for your home.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Rimu & Macrocarpa — Beauty Meets Function</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) is one of New Zealand's most prized native timbers, displaying rich reddish-brown tones with fine, even grain that polishes to a warm, lustrous finish. Its natural beauty makes it particularly fitting for kitchenware that will be displayed as well as used — a Rimu bowl on your kitchen bench is a genuinely striking piece.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Macrocarpa (Cupressus macrocarpa) brings a lighter, golden character with a pleasant natural aroma. Dense and stable, it's an excellent timber for cutting boards and serving pieces that need to withstand regular use. Its warm honey tones complement the richer tones of Rimu beautifully.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          All our timber is sourced from legal, sustainable supplies — primarily salvaged or recycled native timber — to protect New Zealand's native forests.

      {/* Wood vs Plastic */}
      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Wood vs Plastic Kitchenware</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Wood is a naturally superior material for kitchenware in many respects. Unlike plastic, wood doesn't harbour bacteria in surface scratches — wood fibres actually close around cuts and trap bacteria, preventing them from multiplying. Wood is gentler on knife edges than plastic or glass cutting boards. It doesn't leach chemicals into food, and it doesn't degrade into microplastics.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Most importantly, a beautiful handcrafted wooden bowl or board brings genuine warmth and character to your kitchen that no plastic alternative ever could. It's a sustainable, natural choice that gets better with age rather than worse.

      {/* Care */}
      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Care & Maintenance</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hand wash only — do not put wooden kitchenware in the dishwasher or soak in water. Wash with warm soapy water and dry immediately with a cloth. Do not leave standing in water or expose to prolonged moisture.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Every 4–6 weeks (or whenever the wood looks dry), apply a generous coat of food-safe wood oil — such as food-grade mineral oil, coconut oil, or beeswax — and allow to soak in overnight. This keeps the timber nourished, prevents cracking, and maintains the beautiful finish. With regular oiling, your kitchenware will last a lifetime and improve with age.
