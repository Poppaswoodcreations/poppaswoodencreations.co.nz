        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our wooden train sets are handcrafted in Whangarei from native New Zealand timbers — primarily Kauri and Rimu. Each locomotive, carriage, and track piece is shaped and finished entirely by hand in our Tikipunga workshop, creating railway sets with the warmth, weight, and character of genuine handcrafted woodwork.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Wooden trains are among the most enduring of all children's toys — passed down through generations, collected, and cherished. Ours are made to that same standard: built from New Zealand's finest native timbers with craftsmanship that will last a lifetime and beyond.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Kauri & Rimu — A Perfect Pairing</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Kauri (Agathis australis) is New Zealand's most iconic native timber — pale golden in colour with a fine, even grain that works beautifully for the precise shapes required in train sets. Its natural lustre and smooth texture make it a joy to handle, and it takes a natural oil finish exceptionally well.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) brings contrast and warmth — richer, reddish-brown tones with fine grain that polishes to a beautiful depth. Using both timbers together creates train sets with real visual interest and the unmistakable character of New Zealand native wood.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          All timber is sourced from legal, sustainable supplies — primarily salvaged or recycled native timber — to protect New Zealand's native forests.

      {/* Development */}
      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Developmental Benefits of Wooden Train Play</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Railway play is exceptionally rich developmentally. Planning and building a track layout develops spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. Running trains along the track builds fine motor control and hand-eye coordination. Creating stories and scenarios around the railway encourages language development, creativity, and social skills.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Unlike electronic train sets, our wooden trains place the child in complete control — the train moves because the child moves it, the story develops because the child creates it. This kind of active, imaginative play is at the heart of Montessori learning and is why our trains are trusted by Montessori educators across New Zealand.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-900 mb-4">Care & Maintenance</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Dust regularly with a soft dry cloth. Avoid prolonged exposure to water or direct sunlight. Store in a dry place when not in use. Every 6–12 months, apply a small amount of natural wood oil to maintain the timber's finish and keep it looking beautiful. With simple care, a wooden train set from Poppa's will remain a cherished piece for decades.
