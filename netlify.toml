# SPA fallback ONLY - let React Router handle everything

  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

## This removes:
- ❌ All trailing slash redirects
- ❌ All category redirects  
- ❌ All policy page redirects
- ❌ All the conflicting rules causing the loop

## This keeps:
- ✅ Build configuration
- ✅ SPA fallback (so React Router can handle ALL routes)

**Replace your entire `netlify.toml` with just those 6 lines, commit, and deploy!**

And also update `_redirects` to just one line:
```
/*  /index.html  200
